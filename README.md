# Task
Let's say we have range of positive integer numbers from `a` to `b`.\
The task is to find all numbers in this range where square root of this number is prime number.

# Prime number definition
>A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.\
>A factor is a whole numbers that can be divided evenly into another number.\
>The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29.\
>Numbers that have more than two factors are called composite numbers.\
>The number 1 is neither prime nor composite.

# Example

```
$ cd path/to/the/prime/repo
$ g++ main.cpp && ./a.out
Please enter start of range: 1
Please enter end of range: 100
4 is prime (sqrt is 2)
9 is prime (sqrt is 3)
25 is prime (sqrt is 5)
49 is prime (sqrt is 7)
```
